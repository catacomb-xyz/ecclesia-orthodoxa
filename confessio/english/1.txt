I confess to God and to blessed Mary ever-Virgin, to blessed Michael the Archangel, to blessed John the Baptist, and to the holy apostles Peter and Paul, along with all the saints, and you, Father:
Through my fault, through my fault, through my fault, I have sinned, by pride in my abundant evil iniquitous and heinous thought, speech, pollution, suggestion, delectation, consent, word and deed; in perjury, adultery, sacrilege, murder, theft, false witness; I have sinned by sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch, and in my behaviour, my evil vices.
I beg blessed Mary ever-Virgin and all the saints to pray and intercede for me a sinner to our Lord Jesus Christ.

I believe in one God, the Father Almighty,
Maker of Heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible.
And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
the Only-begotten, begotten of the Father before all ages;
Light of Light; true God of true God;
begotten, not made; of one essence with the Father, by Whom all things were made
Who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from the heavens,
and was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary, and became man.
And was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered, and was buried;
and arose again on the third day according to the Scriptures;
and ascended into the heavens, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father;
and shall come again, with glory, to judge both the living and the dead; whose kingdom shall have no end. 
And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord and giver of life; who proceedeth from the Father.
Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; who spake by the prophets.
And in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church.
I confess one Baptism for the remission of sins.
I look for the resurrection of the dead, And the life of the age to come. Amen.
